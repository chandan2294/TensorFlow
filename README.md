# TensorFlow

We will go through brief overview of TensorFlow, then TensorFlowâ€™s low-level API, including tensors, operations, variables,
and special data structures. We then use these tools to customize almost every
component in tf.keras. Finally, we look at how TF Functions can boost performance,
how graphs are generated using AutoGraph and tracing, and what rules to
follow when you write TF Functions.

We will also look at how to efficiently load and preprocess data with
TensorFlow.
